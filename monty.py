Monty Hall Problem

Background info:
Based on the famous gameshow where contestants have a choice to pick between 3 doors
Two doors contain goats, and the contestant loses the game
One door contains money, which is what the contestant desires

Rules:
- The contestant picks one door at random, not knowing what is behind it
- The host opens one of the other doors, and reveals a goat regardless of what lies behind the contestants' door
- The host gives the contestant a choice, whether to switch doors or not
- The contestant makes their choice and their final choice is revealed

Theory:
In the stage where the host opens a door revealing a goat, it might be thought that there is a 50/50 chance if the contestant wins the money or not
However, this is incorrect.
