## Monty Hall Problem

### Background info:
- Based on the famous game show where contestants have a choice to pick between 3 doors  
- Two doors contain goats, and the contestant loses the game if either of these doors are selected  
- One door contains money, which is what the contestant desires  

### Rules:
- The contestant picks one closed door at random, not knowing what is behind it  
- The host opens one of the other remaining doors, and reveals a goat regardless of what lies behind the contestants' door  
- The host gives the contestant a choice, whether to switch doors or not with the other remaining closed door  
- The contestant makes their choice and their final choice is revealed  

### Theory:
In the stage of the game show where the host opens a door revealing a goat, it might be thought that there is a 50/50 chance if the contestant wins the money or not. However, this is incorrect.  

Looking at the problem more closely, it is known that the contestant makes their first choice by picking one of three doors. The contestant thus has a 1 in 3 chance of getting the correct door in their initial guess. If the contestant refuses to change doors when the host reveals one with a goat, their odds will remain the same. But, if the contestant chooses to change doors, they now have a 2 in 3 chance of winning.   

The purpose of this program is to test the theory as to whether or not it stands after multiple repeated trials  

### How to use it 
All you have to do is change the number of trials and run!
